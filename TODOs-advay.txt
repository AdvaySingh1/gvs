- Bug patch for Makefile.am (for the endianess)
- P4 fix (and make configurable)
- Move out of dpdk file


Previous patches:
1. In Makefile.am, we have commented out the following checks:
 - ALL_LOCAL += check-endian (SDNet Endianess variables created issue with OVS vars)
 - ALL_LOCAL += dist-hook-git (our SDNet headers are not in the git distro of OVS)
2. In Makefile.am, we didn't remove the following check:
 - ALL_LOCAL += thread-safety-check
 but instead we removed the thread-unsafe operations from sdnet_nfp_env.c
  - all fprintf()s have been removed
3. #include <config.h> was added to sdnet_nfp_env.c as OVS requires in each source file
